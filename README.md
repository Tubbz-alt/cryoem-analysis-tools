## How to contribute

### Add fred as a remote
Do this once if you do not see fred in the list when you do `git remote -v`:
```
git remote add fred https://github.com/fredericpoitevin/cryoem-analysis-tools
```

### Good practice
Every time you are about to do some work, first make sure you update your version with mine:
```
git pull fred master
```
